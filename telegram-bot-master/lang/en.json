Context is the collection of all messages within your chat that the model uses to make the conversation more coherent and personalized. The more information that accumulates, the more caps may be used for each response.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary expenses, we recommend regularly ***starting a new chat***. This will allow you to \"reset\" the context and continue the dialogue without the accumulated history. To do this, simply click the \"ChatGPT\" button.\n\nIf you want each of your messages to be considered without taking into account previous ones, use the ***\"Don't remember context\"*** feature in the /context section.
